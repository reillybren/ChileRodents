   abstract = {This study aimed to assess the association between habitat type, season, and host density, sex, mass, and body condition with the parasitism (i.e., prevalence and abundance) of two taxa of parasitic mites: Ornithonyssus sp. and Androlaelaps sp. (Mesostigmata) parasitising Abrothrix olivacea (Cricetidae). This study considered habitat types, including both the native forest of westerncentral Chile (NF) and the surrounding pine plantation, which were sub-grouped as adult pine with an abundant understory (AP), young pine with an abundant understory (YPWU), and young pine plantation with a scarce or null understory (YPNU). Rodents were sampled during seasonal trapping sessions in the Los Queules National Reserve (Chile) and in the surrounding pine plantations. The association of these factors with the presence and abundance of mites was assessed with logistic and negative binomial regressions, respectively. Among 484 captured rodents, the prevalence of Ornithonyssus sp. (n=2445 mites) was 70.87%, and that of Androlaelaps sp. (n=182) was 16.1%. Parasitism by Ornithonyssus sp. was higher in plantations than in NF, and it featured seasonal and host sex-associated variation. The parasitism of Androlaelaps sp. in plantations was not significantly different from that in the NF, and only seasonal variation was significant. When comparing YPWU and YPNU, the parasitism of Ornithonyssus sp. was higher in YPWU, and that of Androlaelaps sp. was higher in YPNU. The effect of habitat depended on mite species, as the effect was stronger in Ornithonyssus. Host density was not significantly associated after correcting for habitat and season; this consideration was not frequently found in previous studies. There is a different effect of habitat type for each mite species, and the results also suggest an effect of the understory on the parasitism of each mite species.},

Both analyses showed two groups separated for species of rodents. Mites associated with P. xanthopygus are smaller than those of A. albiventer. The analysis by location indicates two groups: group 1 comprises all mites collected from Fray Jorge National Park and Las Chinchillas National Reserve, and group 2 comprises only mites from Llanos de Challe National Park. These results indicate that A. fahrenholzi population can vary between hosts and geographical areas. Molecular analysis would be necessary to validate these results and determine whether they are subspecies or different species.},

The presented study aimed to determine the prevalence and species richness of rodent-associated trombiculid mites and their infection with Orientia spp. in different areas of two regions in southern Chile.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During summer 2020, trombiculid mites were collected from rodents captured in three areas in southern Chile known to be endemic for scrub typhus (Cochamo and Chiloe Island in the Los Lagos Region and Tortel in the Aysen Region). A total of 132 rodents belonging to five species were captured using Sherman-like traps; 89.4% were infested with trombiculids. Mite specimens were morphologically identified and subsequently tested by Orientia-specific qPCR. Six mite species were identified. Among chigger-infested rodents, 33.9% carried Orientia-positive mites; this rate was higher in Tortel (63.8%) than in Cochamo (45.0%) and Chiloe Island (2.0%). The analysis of individual mites (n = 901) revealed that 31.2% of Herpetacarus antarctica samples (n = 202) were positive for Orientia DNA; the prevalence was 7.0% in Paratrombicula neuquenensis (n = 213), 6.9% in Herpetacarus eloisae (n = 144), 3.6% in Argentinacarus expansus (n = 55), and 0% in Paratrombicula goffi (n = 110) and Quadraseta chiloensis (n = 177). The southernmost site (Tortel) showed the highest rates of trombiculid infestation, trombiculid load, and Orientia infection in the captured rodents.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides new insights into the trombiculid fauna and prevalence of Orientia in mites collected from wild rodents in southern Chile. Orientia DNA was detected in four of the six mite species. Rates of infestation, mite loads, and Orientia prevalences differed geographically and were highest in the Aysen Region. Our data improve our knowledge on possible vectors of scrub typhus and their distribution in Chile.},

   abstract = {The black rat (Rattus rattus) is an invasive species and potential reservoir of significant pathogens of man, domestic animals and wildlife. During the 2012-2014 austral summers, 201 black rats were captured and examined on the uninhabited Guafo Island, in Northern Chilean Patagonia (43.593029°S, 74.713481°W). The mite Ornithonyssus bacoti caused lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic dermatitis in all infected rats (105/210, 52%), but no skin lesions were observed in rats infected with Nosopsyllus spp. and Plocopsylla spp. fleas. Eighty-eight rats (44%) had mild lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic enterocolitis and 61 of these rats were infected with the nematode Heterakis spumosa. In the liver, 63 animals (31%) had areas of necrosis with histiocytic and eosinophilic inflammation associated with multiple Calodium hepaticum eggs, and in 15 cases there was co-infection with several Taenia taeniaeformis strobilocerci. Mild interstitial lymphoplasmacytic sialadenitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies, suggesting cytomegalovirus infection, was observed in 28 rats (15%). In the lung, alveolar histiocytosis (69 rats, 34%) and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates (46 rats, 23%) were the most common findings. There was mild to moderate lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis in 52 rats (26%) and in 15% of these cases Leptospira spp. antigen was detected in the distal renal tubules. Some of the diseases of black rats on Guafo Island are likely to play a role in rat population dynamics. The endemic Guafo Island long-clawed mole mouse (Geoxus lafkenche), sea lions and fur seals may be at risk for infection by some of these rat pathogens.},

The Craneopsyllinae (Siphonaptera: Stephanocircidae) represent one of the most commonly found subfamilies in this region and show some endemism and high diversity. Plocopsylla is the most diverse genus of Craneopsyllinae; it includes 10 species mainly distributed in the Patagonian subregion, which parasitize sigmodontine rodents (Rodentia: Cricetidae). We describe and illustrate the morphology of the aedeagus in species of Plocopsylla that belong to the 'angusticeps-lewisi' complex. This character is of diagnostic value in differentiating among species. A new species of this complex, Plocopsylla (Plocopsylla) linardii sp. n., is described and identified by the shape and chaetotaxy of the distal arm of sternite IX, as well as by the shape of the median dorsal lobe of the aedeagus. New host associations for this complex and range extensions for most of its species are reported. Plocopsylla (P.) silewi is recorded for the first time in Argentina. The southern limits of the distributions of Plocopsylla (P.) lewisi and Plocopsylla (P.) wilesi are extended to Santa Cruz Province. The angusticeps-lewisi complex is found for the first time in San Juan Province. The information may be useful in epidemiological studies of flea-borne diseases.},

There are many metrics to quantify the node centrality in networks. Here, we review the main centrality measures and discuss their main features and limitations. The influence of network centrality on epidemic spreading and synchronization is also pointed out in this chapter. Moreover, we present the application of centrality measures to understand the function of complex systems, including biological and cortical networks. Finally, we discuss some perspectives and challenges to generalize centrality measures for multilayer and temporal networks.},

   abstract = {A new argasid (Argasidae) tick is herein described based on morphology and molecular data obtained from larvae parasitizing Octodon degus and from ticks collected inside burrows in northern Chile. Unfed laboratory-reared larvae were mounted in slides for morphometrical and morphological analyses. Larvae of Ornithodoros octodontus n. sp. share morphological traits with Ornithodoros quilinensis and Ornithodoros xerophylus, two species associated with rodents in the Argentinean Chaco. However, a longer hypostome with two rows of 21 and 22 denticles each one, and conspicuous leaf-shaped anal plates separate O. octodontus. While nymphal stages of O. octodontus lack cheeks and possess a micromammillated dorsal integument, adults have cheeks and exhibit markedly irregular mammillae along their dorsal surface. Phylogenetic analyses of neotropical Argasidae based on mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequences point that O. octodontus forms a monophyletic group with O. xerophylus and an unidentified Ornithodoros sp. from Bolivia, all of them associated with burrow-dweller rodents. Ornithodoros aragaoi and Ornithodoros davisi, two rare species collected once only in the Peruvian Andean Plateau during 1955 are morphologically closely related with adults and nymphs of O. octodontus. Biological observations of O. octodontus revealed autogenic females. For the moment, subgeneric classification of this new species depends on further biological studies. The fauna of ticks occurring in Chile is now represented by 22 species, 11 belonging to the Argasidae family.},

Tick-borne relapsing fever Borrelia and spotted fever Rickettsia occur in endemic foci along tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. However, both are widely neglected etiologic agents. In this study, we performed molecular analyses in order to assess the presence of Borrelia and Rickettsia DNA in ticks infesting small-mammals within a National Reserve located in the Andes Mountains, central Chile. While hard ticks were negative for the presence of both agents, sequences of four rickettsial (gltA, htrA, ompA, ompB) and two borrelial (16S rRNA and flaB) genes were obtained from larvae of an Ornithodoros sp. morphologically related with Ornithodoros atacamensis. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the detected Borrelia and Rickettsia spp. belong to the relapsing fever and spotted fever groups, respectively. Moreover, the agents formed monophyletic clades with Rickettsia amblyommatis and " Candidatus Borrelia johnsonii."As positive ticks parasitize rodents within a highly visited National Reserve where outdoor activities are of common practice, the risk for human parasitism should not be discarded.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to molecularly survey Bartonella spp. in rodents from the Valdivia Province, Southern Chile and from wild black rat-fieas in Guafo Island, Chilean Patagonia. Thrity-three spleens from synanthropic (Mus musculus, Rattus novergicus and Rattus rattus) and wild (Abrothrix longipilis, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, Abrothrix sp.) rodents from Valdivia and 39 fieas/fiea-pools (Plocopsylla sp. and Nosopsyllus sp.) from R. rattus in Guafo Island were obtained. All samples were screened by high-resolution melting (HRM) real-time PCR for Bartonella ITS locus (190 bp). ITS-Positive samples were further analyzed for two HRM real-time PCR assays targeting Bartonella rpoB (191 bp) and gltA (340 bp) gene fragments. All positive ITS, gltA and rpoB real-time PCR products were purified and sequenced. Bayesian inference trees were built for the gltA and rpoB gene fragments. Bartonella-ITS DNA was detected in 36.3% (12/33) [95% CI (22-53%)] of the tested rodents from Valdivia, being identified in all but O. longicaudatus rodent species captured in this study. ITS DNA was detected in 28% (11/39) [95% CI (16-43%)] of fieas/fiea-pools from Guafo Island and identified in both Plocopsylla and Nosopsyllus genera. Sequencing and phylogenic analyses targeting three loci of Bartonella spp. allowed the identification of five genotypes in rodents from Southern Chile, potentially belonging to three different Bartonella spp. Those included Bartonella tribocorum identified from R. rattus, Bartonella rochalimae detected from Abrothix sp., and one novel genotype from uncharacterized Bartonella sp. identified in M. musculus, R. norvegicus, A. longipilis, and Abothrix sp., related to strains previously isolated in Phyllotis sp. from Peru. Additionally, two genotypes of B. tribocorum were identified in fieas from Guafo. In a nutshell, highly diverse and potentially zoonotic Bartonella spp. are described for the first time in wild and synanthropic rodents from Chile, and B. tribocorum was detected in wild back rat fieas from Guafo Island.},

   abstract = {Background: Rickettsial diseases are considered important in public health due to their dispersal capacity determined by the particular characteristics of their reservoirs and/or vectors. Among the latter, fleas play an important role, since the vast majority of species parasitize wild and invasive rodents, so their detection is relevant to be able to monitor potential emerging diseases. The aim of this study was to detect, characterize, and compareRickettsiaspp. from the fleas of micromammals in areas with different human population densities in Chile.Methods: The presence ofRickettsiaspp. was evaluated by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing in 1315 fleas collected from 1512 micromammals in 29 locations, with different human population densities in Chile. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to identify the variables that may explainRickettsiaprevalence in fleas.Results: DNA ofRickettsiaspp. was identified in 13.2% (174 of 1315) of fleas tested. Fifteen flea species were found to beRickettsia-positive. The prevalence ofRickettsiaspp. was higher in winter, semi-arid region and natural areas, and the infection levels in fleas varied between species of flea. The prevalence ofRickettsiaamong flea species ranged between 0-35.1%. Areas of lower human density showed the highest prevalence ofRickettsia. The phylogenetic tree showed two well-differentiated clades withRickettsia belliipositioned as basal in one clade. The second clade was subdivided into two subclades of species related toRickettsiaof the spotted fever group.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence and molecular characterization ofRickettsiaspp. in 15 flea species of micromammals in Chile. In this study, fleas were detected carryingRickettsiaDNA with zoonotic potential, mainly in villages and natural areas of Chile. Considering that there are differences in the prevalence ofRickettsiain fleas associated with different factors, more investigations are needed to further understand the ecology ofRickettsiain fleas and their implications for human health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rattus rattus is a widely distributed, invasive species that presents an important role in disease transmission, either directly or through vector arthropods such as fleas. These black rats can transmit a wide variety of pathogens, including bacteria of the genus Bartonella, which can cause diseases in humans and animals. In Chile, no data are available identifying fleas from synanthropic rodents as Bartonella vectors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Bartonella spp. in the fleas of R. rattus in areas with different climate conditions and featuring different human population densities. METHODS: In all, 174 fleas collected from 261 R. rattus captured from 30 localities with different human densities (cities, villages, and wild areas) across five hydrographic zones of Chile (hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and hyper-humid) were examined. Bartonella spp. presence was determined through polymerase chain reaction, using gltA and rpoB genes, which were concatenated to perform a similarity analysis with BLAST and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 15 fleas species were identified; Bartonella gltA and rpoB fragments were detected in 21.2% (37/174) and 19.5% (34/174) of fleas, respectively. A total of 10 of the 15 fleas species found were positive for Bartonella DNA. Leptopsylla segnis was the most commonly collected flea species (n = 55), and it also presented a high prevalence of Bartonella DNA (P% = 34.5%). The highest numbers of fleas of this species were collected in villages of the arid zone. There were no seasonal differences in the prevalence of Bartonella DNA. The presence of Bartonella DNA in fleas was recorded in all hydrographic areas, and the arid zone presented the highest prevalence of this species. Regarding areas with different human densities, the highest prevalence was noted in the villages (34.8% gltA and 31.8% rpoB), followed by cities (14.8% gltA and 11.1% rpoB) and wild areas (7.4% gltA and 14.8% rpoB). The BLAST analysis showed a high similitude (>96%) with four uncharacterized Bartonella genotypes and with two species with zoonotic potential: B. mastomydis and B. tribocorum. The phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with B. elizabethae and B. tribocorum. This is the first study to provide evidence of the presence of Bartonella in fleas of R. rattus in Chile, indicating that the villages and arid zone correspond to areas with higher infection risk.},

   abstract = {Invasive populations are a threat to biodiversity, resulting in the loss of species, and also a threat to human health, participating in the reservoir of diseases. Rodents are among the most important invasive species worldwide. Chile is a country that features island conditions in terms of geography and has been widely invaded by allochthonous rodents. In this mini-review, we updated the literature on macro-parasites infecting both native and invasive rodents and of vector-borne pathogens in continental Chile in order to assess the relative importance of invasive rodents from both ecological and public health points of view. A total of 174 parasite species were found, with Siphonaptera representing the most diverse group. When examining how parasites are shared between native and introduced rodents, the analysis suggests that parasites circulate freely within recipient populations, and are not significantly transmitted from source populations. Further, generalist parasites are typically more prone to being shared between native and introduced rodents. Most zoonotic parasites were reported in invasive rodents, suggesting that these rodents must represent a public health concern. Although several vector-borne pathogens have been reported in rodents or ectoparasites, most of the recently emerging research has illustrated that there is a lack of evidence on rodent-vector-borne zoonoses in most pathogens.},

In Chile, Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni is the only recognized species Gigantolaelaps and it has only been reported from four localities, always in association with Oligoryzomys longicaudatus. Our research study aimed to contribute to the severely limited information about the ecology and distribution of G. wolffsohni in Chile and determine whether factors such as season, ecological region and weight-and sex of the host influence the abundance of this mite. We captured and assessed 329 O. longicaudatus in different seasons and localities. We classified sampled localities as being part of the Mediterranean, Template Forest, or Magellanic Forest ecoregion due to reported genetic and morphological differences of O. longicaudatus between ecoregions. Information about the season, ecoregion, and weight and sex of the host were recorded during mite sampling. These variables were assessed to determine their influence on mite abundance and prevalence through negative binomial and logistic regression models. We found 19 new localities where G. wolffsohni is distributed in Chile. These mites displayed an aggregated distribution in all ecoregions. We found that biogeography, weight, and sex of the host are not related to the abundance and prevalence of G. wolffsohni. Nonetheless, we found a strong association between the season and the abundance and prevalence of mites. All mites found were females; additionally, we found larva stage inside some female mites. We discussed the relationship between different ecological aspects and the abundance and prevalence of ectoparasites. Also, we discussed the finding of the larvae of G. wolffsohni, which means that this specie is at least larviparous, and finally, we discuss the specificity of Laelapidae mites.},

   abstract = {Abstract Traditionally, most studies have described the organization of host–parasite interaction networks by considering only few host groups at limited geographical extents. However, host–parasite relationships are merged within different taxonomic groups and factors shaping these interactions likely differ between host and parasite groups, making group-level differences important to better understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these interactive communities. Here we used a dataset of 629 ectoparasite species and 251 species of terrestrial mammals, comprising 10 orders distributed across the Nearctic and Neotropical regions of Mexico to assess the species-level drivers of mammalian ectoparasite faunas. Specifically, we evaluated whether body weight, geographical range size and within-range mammal species richness (i.e. diversity field) predict mammal ectoparasite species richness (i.e. degree centrality) and their closeness centrality within the mammal–ectoparasite network. In addition, we also tested if the observed patterns differ among mammal orders and if taxonomic closely related host mammals could more likely share the same set of ectoparasites. We found that ectoparasite species richness of small mammals (mainly rodents) with large proportional range sizes was high compared to large-bodied mammals, whereas the diversity field of mammals had no predictive value (except for bats). We also observed that taxonomic proximity was a main determinant of the probability to share ectoparasite species. Specifically, the probability to share ectoparasites in congeneric species reached up to 90% and decreased exponentially as the taxonomic distance increased. Further, we also detected that some ectoparasites are generalists and capable to infect mammalian species across different orders and that rodents have a remarkable role in the network structure, being closely connected to many other taxa. Hence, because many rodent species have synanthropic habits they could act as undesired reservoirs of disease agents for humans and urban animals. Considering the reported worldwide phenomenon of the proliferation of rodents accompanying the demographic decrease or even local extinction of large-bodied mammal species, these organisms may already be an increasing health threat in many regions of the world.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus is an emerging vector-borne zoonosis, caused by Orientia spp. and transmitted by larvae of trombiculid mites, called chiggers. It mainly occurs within a region of the Asia-Pacific called the tsutsugamushi triangle, where rodents are known as the most relevant hosts for the trombiculid vector. However, the reservoir(s) and vector(s) of the scrub typhus outside Asia-Pacific are unknown. The disease has recently been discovered on and is considered endemic for Chiloé Island in southern Chile. The aim of the present work was to detect and determine the prevalence of chiggers on different rodent species captured in probable sites for the transmission of orientiae responsible for scrub typhus on Chiloé Island in southern Chile and to molecularly examine collected chiggers for the presence of Orientia DNA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the austral summer 2018, rodents were live-trapped in six sites and examined for chigger infestation. All study sites were rural areas on Chiloé Island, previously identified as probable localities where human cases acquired the scrub typhus. During a total of 4,713 trap-nights, 244 rodents of seven species were captured: the most abundant was Abrothrix olivacea. Chiggers were detected on all seven rodent species with a 55% prevalence rate. Chiggers showed low host specificity and varied according to site specific host abundance. Three genera of trombiculids were identified. Herpetacarus was the most abundant genus (93%), prevalent in five of the six sites. Infestation rates showed site specific differences, which were statistically significant using a GLM model with binomial errors. Molecular analyses proved that 21 of 133 (15.8%) mite pools were positive for Orientia species, all of them belonged to the genus Herpetacarus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study firstly reports the presence of different rodent-associated chigger mites positive for Orientia sp., in a region endemic for scrub typhus in southern Chile. Herpetacarus and two other genera of mites were found with high infestation rates of rodents in sites previously identified as probable exposure of scrub typhus cases. A substantial percentage of mite pools were positive for Orientia DNA, suggesting that chigger mites serve as vectors and reservoirs of this emerging zoonosis in South America.},
